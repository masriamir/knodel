# knodel

`knodel` is an experimental toolkit that helps you author [Tidal Cycles](https://tidalcycles.org/) patterns using modern Python. The package offers a set of Pythonic abstractions that mirror the constructs described in the official [Tidal documentation](https://tidalcycles.org/docs/) so that you can describe musical ideas with familiar object-oriented techniques and transpile them into Haskell code that runs inside a live Tidal environment.

## Project goals

* Provide a strongly-typed Python fa√ßade for common Tidal concepts (patterns, controls, and synthesizers).
* Support ergonomic composition helpers such as stacking and concatenating patterns.
* Offer an extensible transpilation pipeline that can export ready-to-run `.tidal` source files.
* Remain faithful to idiomatic Tidal syntax so the generated code is immediately recognisable to live-coders.

This repository contains the initial groundwork for these goals. Future iterations can continue to enrich the set of supported synths, controls, and higher-level musical structures.

## Requirements

* Python 3.13
* [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for dependency management

The project intentionally has no runtime dependencies beyond the Python standard library. Development tooling (formatting, linting, and testing) is handled by `ruff` and `pytest` through `uv` dependency groups.

## Getting started

Clone the repository and create an isolated environment managed by `uv`:

```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install --group dev
```

### Running the example session

The `examples` directory contains a minimal session that layers a supersaw and a super pulse-width modulation synthesizer pattern. You can transpile it into Tidal code via the package's CLI:

```bash
uv run python -m knodel examples.basic_session:create_session --output demo.tidal
cat demo.tidal
```

The generated file is ready to be loaded into a running Tidal Cycles interpreter.

### Writing your own sessions

1. Import the provided primitives:
   ```python
   from knodel.patterns import Pattern
   from knodel.session import TidalSession
   from knodel.synths import SuperSaw
   ```
2. Instantiate synthesizer wrappers, optionally configuring their controls.
3. Use the pattern helpers (e.g., `stack`, `fast`, `slow`) to build complex layers.
4. Add the resulting patterns to a `TidalSession` and transpile using `TidalTranspiler`.

For example:

```python
from knodel.patterns import Pattern
from knodel.session import TidalSession
from knodel.synths import SuperPWM, SuperSaw

session = TidalSession()
supersaw = SuperSaw(cutoff=1200, detune=0.4).to_pattern()
pwm = SuperPWM(pwidth=0.7).to_pattern().fast(2)
session.configure(setcps="0.6")
session.set_stream("d1", Pattern.stack([supersaw, pwm]))
```

Finally, call `TidalTranspiler` to generate the Haskell snippet:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from knodel.transpiler import TidalTranspiler

transpiler = TidalTranspiler()
output = transpiler.transpile(session)
Path("session.tidal").write_text(output, encoding="utf-8")
```

## Running tests and linters

The repository includes a small Pytest suite that exercises the synthesizer wrappers, pattern composition helpers, and transpiler pipeline. Execute the checks using `uv run` so that all dependencies are resolved within the managed environment:

```bash
uv run pytest
```

`ruff` handles linting and formatting. You can run it manually if needed:

```bash
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format .
```

## Contributing

Contributions that expand the set of synthesizers, add more pattern combinators, or improve the transpiler are welcome. Please follow the established Google-style docstrings and ensure that the automated tests continue to pass.
