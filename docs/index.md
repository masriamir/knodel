## ðŸ“š About knodel

`knodel` is an experimental toolkit that helps the authoring of Tidal Cycles patterns using modern Python.
The package offers a set of Pythonic abstractions that mirror the constructs described in the official Tidal documentation.
This architecture allows the description of musical ideas with familiar object-oriented techniques,
as well as transpiling them into Haskell code that runs inside a live Tidal environment.
