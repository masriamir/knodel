## ðŸ“š About knodel

`knodel` is an experimental toolkit that helps you author Tidal Cycles patterns using modern Python. The package offers a set of Pythonic abstractions that mirror the constructs described in the official Tidal documentation so that you can describe musical ideas with familiar object-oriented techniques and transpile them into Haskell code that runs inside a live Tidal environment.
